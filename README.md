Hello Everyone.
Welcome to my repository.
Here i have created my first Task of the virtual internship provided by InternChain where i had to create a landing page.
I had the internship in web development Field where i made this landing page of a non-profitable startup-page TechStack.
A landing page is customized to specific campaign or offers and guide visitors toward a single call action. 
In the CSS part i used - "@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Ubuntu:wght@300&display=swap')" for using some of related fonts.
